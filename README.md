A simple wrapper on NSThread to run blocks on *exactly* the same thread. It’s guaranteed First-In-First-Out (FIFO). 

This code is based on the following StackOverflow answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/22091859. Permission to redistribute has been granted by the original author ([Marc Haisenko](https://github.com/darkdust)).

```swift
let thread = Thread()
thread.enqueue {
    // Block is run on the thread
}
```
Blocks are removed from the queue just before they get run.

Start and cancel the life time of a thread:
```swift
// Initialize unstarted
let thread = Thread(start: false)
thread.enqueue {
    // ...
}
thread.enqueue {
    // ...
}
// Start the thread to begin running queued up blocks
thread.start()
// and maybe stop the thread again. Blocks still in the queue
thread.cancel()
```

Pause and resume:
```swift
let thread = Thread()
thread.enqueue {
    // ...
}
// Pause
thread.pause()

// ... do other stuff

thread.enqueue {
    //...
}
// Begin running blocks from queue again
thread.resume()
```

Empty queue:
```swift
// Remove any blocks still in queue
thread.emptyQueue()
```

Pre-enqueue with blocks:
```swift
let thread = Thread(queue: [
    { /* … */ },
    { /* … */ }
])
```

### When *not* to use
**Thread** is very strict for running on *exactly* the same thread. For do-on-background-return-on-main stuff, use the brilliant [**Async**](https://github.com/duemunk/Async) wrapper for GCD.
